# Discrete Mathematics

I like to understand discrete mathematics as the mathematics of the natural numbers (since it basically is, given the natural numbers are pretty much teh discrete space of numbers).

I will try to gather all my work and info here so it doesn't just dissapear like my regular class data usually does.
