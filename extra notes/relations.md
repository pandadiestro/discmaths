# Relations

<div "text-align: center">
We should start by stating that we consider relations themselves to be existent in contexts.
</div>

We can represent them as the clasic $R$ as a set of mappings from a set to another one

$${(-3, 1), (-2, 0)}$$

or as a matrix, where, for a relation $R$:

$$r_{ij} = \left \{ \begin{matrix}
    1 & if & (a_{ij}, b_{ij}) \in R \\
    0 & if & (a_{ij}, b_{ij}) \notin R \\
\end{matrix} \right .$$

Now, we can define inverse relationships, when for all $R$ relationships:

$$R^{-1} = \{(b, a) / (a, b) \in R\}$$

## Kinds of relationships

For a certain relationship $R$

1. Reflexive: $\forall a \in A, (a, a) \in R$
